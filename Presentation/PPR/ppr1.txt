1)We had first started by making an abstract of our project
in which we have given the brief view about the idea behind the 
project and then started with the documentation.

2)As many real world problems has been solved through different
advancement in technologies so selecting an effective definition
which can bring comfort and easiness in people's lives was the
main challenge at first.

3)We discussed with our friends and relatives about the project
and after knowing the problems faced by all, we asked our internal
guide for help in documentation.

4)We referred some software engineering books for the 
Software Development Life Cycle through which we studied 
about how to make documentation.
